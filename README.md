# Shopping Customer Segmentation Project

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to understand the target customers for the marketing team of a shopping mall. The goal is to identify the most important shopping groups based on age, income, and mall shopping score, and to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Context

In today's competitive market, understanding customer behavior is essential for businesses to tailor their marketing efforts effectively. In this project, our boss wants us to segment the mall's target market into approachable groups based on demographic and behavioral criteria. By doing so, we aim to gain a better understanding of the target market's activities and preferences.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Divide the mall's target market into distinct groups using clustering techniques.
2. Create subsets of market demographics and behavioral criteria to better understand the target market's activities.
3. Provide actionable insights for the marketing team based on the identified clusters.

## Approach

To achieve our objectives, we followed these steps:

1. **Quick Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We performed initial exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

2. **K-means Clustering Algorithm**: We utilized the K-means clustering algorithm to segment the target market into distinct groups based on age, income, and mall shopping score.

3. **Summary Statistics on Clusters**: After clustering, we calculated summary statistics for each cluster to understand the demographic and behavioral characteristics of each group.

4. **Visualization**: We visualized the clusters to provide clear insights into the distribution and differences among them.

## Analysis

Based on our analysis, we identified two main clusters:

1. **Cluster 1**: This group consists of customers with high income and high spending scores. Approximately 60% of the customers in this cluster are women. We recommend targeting this group with marketing campaigns tailored to popular items within the cluster to attract more female customers.

2. **Cluster 2**: This group presents an interesting opportunity for the marketing team as it represents customers who show interest in popular items. Further analysis and targeted sales strategies on popular items could be beneficial for this cluster.

## Final Analysis and Recommendations

The target group for the marketing team is Cluster 1, characterized by high spending scores and high income. Since a significant portion of this cluster comprises women, focusing on marketing campaigns tailored to popular items among female customers can help attract and retain them. Additionally, Cluster 2 provides an opportunity for targeted sales strategies on popular items to capitalize on customer interest and increase sales.

By understanding the distinct segments within the target market and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly, the mall can enhance customer engagement, increase sales, and strengthen its competitive position in the market.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of data-driven insights in understanding customer behavior and optimizing marketing strategies. By leveraging clustering techniques and analyzing customer demographics and behaviors, businesses can effectively target their marketing efforts and improve overall performance.
